    <h2>A few of my projects</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Trott/music-routes-data">Music Routes Data</a></h3>
    <p>While running <a href="http://musicroutes.com">Music Routes</a>, I collected a ton of data about what musicians play on what tracks. I decided that I shouldn't bogart that information.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Trott/music-routes-visualization">Music Routes Visualization</a></h3>
    <p>Visualiations for the data above.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Trott/CampusKit">CampusKit</a></h3>
    <p>Make mobile/tablet sites/apps quickly. Geared towards resource-strapped higher education, but useful for anyone.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Trott/webconf-bingo">Web Conference Bingo Cards</a></h3>
    <p>Just for fun. Web conferences should probably have a snappier interface and more gee-whiz features. Why don't you open a pull request, smarty-pants?</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Trott/apis.ucsf.edu">APIs server</a></h3>
    <p>JavaScript API server. I talk about this in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrxtCDiYNlg">Fostering a Culture of Sharing with Code</a>.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Trott/clockdrift.js">clockdrift.js</a></h3>
    <p>Need to monitor the time setting on a web server that you don't have access to? Let clockdrift.js do it for you!</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Trott/my-radar">My-Radar</a></h3>
    <p>My-Radar is a Google App Engine web app that lets you allow others to track you on a map.</p>

    <h3><a href="/LightningTouch">Lightning Touch</a></h3>
    <div><small><b>Deprecated!</b> Use <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick">FastClick</a> instead.</small></div>
    <p>You know that delay of a few hundred milliseconds on touch devices when you're browsing the web? Use Lightning Touch to get rid of that delay on your site.</p>

    <h3><a href="/pickyfill">pickyfill</a></h3>
    <div><small><b>Deprecated!</b> We'll have ServiceWorker and native picture elements soon, right?</small></div>
    <p>Are you frustrated by the incompatibilities between responsive image solutions (like <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">picturefill</a>) and HTML5 offline appcaching? Pickyfill may ease some of your pains. (Unless you need those pains eased on Android 2.3.)</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/Trott/cordova-linter">cordova-linter</a></h3>
    <div><small><b>Unmaintained!</b> Doesn't do a whole lot and I'm not doing Cordova projects anymore, so this isn't getting much love, sorry to say.</small></div>
    <p>Find common patterns in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that are incompatible with Apache Cordova and PhoneGap.</p>
